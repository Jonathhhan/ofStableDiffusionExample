# ofStableDiffusionExample

This is an Open Frameworks (https://openframeworks.cc/) implementation of: https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp

Download the ggml model or the checkpoint (and convert it to ggml: https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp) for sd 2.1 nano from here: https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp/issues/28#issuecomment-1694486320
And put the ggml file into the model folder.
If possible compile with AVX2, it is much faster.
